This document describes the development of web services for Examination
Attendance System using Spring Boot as the framework. In this project, Maven
will be used as a tool for implementing the web service for both provider and
consumer. For the front-end at consumer side, languages such as Thymeleaf,
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) are used
to design the webpage.

This document contains several sections including project structure, data
structure, implementation of data layer, implementation of web services,
